# Gitconfig

A set of Bash scripts for setting up my Git configuration. The scripts are tailored to my personal preferences but they are simple enough to be easily adapted to suit your own needs, so help yourself.

## Usage

Just run the scripts in any console supporting Bash commands. On Windows use Git Bash, on Linux any terminal should work. To create global Git configuration file, run:

    make_gitconfig

And to create global `.gitignore` file, run:

    make_gitignore

That's it, done!
